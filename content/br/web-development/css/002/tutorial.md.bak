# Browser DevTools for CSS

Before we go on with CSS, I have to show you a tool you’ll use all the time: the **Browser DevTools**.

This set of tools is available in any browser.

In Chrome, Firefox, and Edge you can right-click on any page and have access to the DevTools by clicking the **Inspect** menu.

This is what shows up:

A similar menu is available in Safari too, but you need to enable the Develop menu from the configuration.

The DevTools are more or less similar in all browsers. 

The most basic form of usage, and a very common one, is inspecting the content of a webpage, like in the above pictures, using the **Elements/Inspector panel**.

There you can select any of the HTML tags of the page, and see the styling applied to them (we’ll use this a lot when we’ll build web pages). This works for your sites, but also for every site on the Internet. You can inspect how they are built.
