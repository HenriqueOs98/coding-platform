# PRACTICE: Formatting text

Let's start from the last lesson, and we're going to see how we can format our text by adding special text formatting tags that the browser will interpret and apply a special visual appearance to them.

Let's make a portion of the paragraph bold using the `strong` tag, and another part italicized using the `em` tag, which stands for *emphasis*:

You can cut a paragraph in the middle using the `br` tag, which stands for *break line*:

This tag is different from the others, because it's a self-closing tag: it does not need a closing tag.

Another popular self-closing tag is `hr`, horizontal ruler:

Another useful tag is `blockquote`, used to add quotes to the text:

```html
<blockquote>A quote from a famous author</blockquote>

```

and `q`, used for the same goal, but displays the quote inline instead than on its own block. Notice in this example the browser puts quotes around it:

It's important to note that you will be able style those elements as you like using CSS, but by default the browser adds those styling options.

Lists are another great tool when writing and formatting text.

You have 3 kinds of lists: ordered lists, unordered lists, and definition lists.

Unordered lists are the most common ones, and you define them using the `ul` tag. Each item is wrapped in a `li` tag:

An ordered list is similar, it just changes `ul` (unordered list) to `ol` (ordered list):

You can nest lists:

Definition lists are used to create glossaries, for example. We have a term, and a definition:
