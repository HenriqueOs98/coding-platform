# HTTP methods

HTTP is based on methods.

Each method used performs a very different action.

The most popular are `GET` and `POST`.

### `GET`

GET is the most used method. It's the one that's used when you type an URL in the browser address bar, or when you click a link.

It asks the server to send the requested resource as a response.

### `HEAD`

HEAD is just like GET, but tells the server to not send the response body back. Just the headers.

### `POST`

The client uses the POST method to send data to the server. It's typically used in forms, for example, but also when interacting with a REST API.

### `PUT`

The PUT method is intended to create a resource at that specific URL, with the parameters passed in the request body. Mainly used in REST APIs

### `DELETE`

The DELETE method is called against an URL to request deletion of that resource. Mainly used in REST APIs

### `OPTIONS`

When a server receives an OPTIONS request it should send back the list of HTTP methods allowed for that specific URL.

### `TRACE`

Returns back to the client the request that has been received. Used for debugging or diagnostic purposes.
