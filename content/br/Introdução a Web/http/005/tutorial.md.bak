# HTTP Request Headers

Every HTTP request has a set of mandatory and optional headers.

We have a lot of them, but here I'll list you the most important / useful ones.

### Host

`Host: flaviocopes.com`

The domain name of the server, and the port number on which the server is listening. If the port is omitted, 80 is assumed.

This is the only mandatory HTTP request header

All the other headers are listed in alphabetical order.

### Accept

`Accept: application/json`

The MIME type we'll want the response to be

### Accept-Charset

`Accept-Charset: utf-8`

Lists the charset we'll want the response to be

### Accept-Encoding

`Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate`

List of acceptable encodings we'll want the response to be

### Accept-Language

`Accept-Language: en-US`

List of languages we'll want the response to be

### Authorization

`Authorization: Basic 34i3j4iom2323==`

To pass authentication credentials, for example a token

### Cache-Control

We can set the caching rules using this header.

- `Cache-Control: no-cache` tells the server to revalidate the data before sending the response to make sure it's current
- `Cache-Control: max-age=30` tells the server we want data that's not older than 30 seconds

### Content-Length

`Content-Length: 348`

The length of the request body in bytes

### Content-Type

`Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded`

The content type of the body of the request (used in POST and PUT requests).

### Cookie

`Cookie: name=value`

Sets a cookie

### Referer

`Referer: <https://flaviocopes.com`>

The address of the previous web page from which a link to the currently requested page was followed.
