# An HTTP request

What's in a request?

The first thing is **the URL**, which we've already seen before.

When we enter an address and press enter in our browser, under the hoods the server sends to the correct IP address a request like this:

```
GET /a-page
```

where /a-page is the URL you requested.

The second thing is **the HTTP method** (also called verb).

HTTP in the early days defined 3 of them:

- `GET`
- `POST`
- `HEAD`

and HTTP/1.1 introduced

- `PUT`
- `DELETE`
- `OPTIONS`
- `TRACE`

We'll see them in detail in a minute.

The third thing that composes a request is a set of **HTTP headers**.

The client sets **request headers** to communicate something to the server when we make a request.

For example the client can set an authorization token, or a cookie, or set a language.

And the server can use **response headers** to communicate information back.

For example, the content encoding, the content type, when it was last modified, etc.

Finally, in some kinds of requests (`POST` and `PUT` requests) we can have a **request body**.
