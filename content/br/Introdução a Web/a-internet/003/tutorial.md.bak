# Introduction to HTML

HTML is the *message* that’s exchanged between the Web Server and the Web Browser.

It’s the core, most fundamental building block of Web Development.

HTML stands for "Hyper Text Markup Language", which means it's a **markup language**.

It’s not strictly a programming language, purists would say.

In an HTML file, we basically write text, as we would in a plain text file, but we save it with the `.html` file extension.

This file contains some content, think paragraphs or titles, organized with some *markup* that the browser uses to get information on how to visualize this content to the end user.

Here's an example of HTML in action:

```html
<p>A paragraph of text</p>

<ul>
  <li>First item</li>
  <li>Second item</li>
  <li>Third item</li>
</ul>
```

This HTML snippet says that `A paragraph of text` is a **paragraph**. And then we have a **list** of 3 items.

`p` stands for *paragraph*, `ul` stands for *unordered list*, and `li` stands for *list item*.

For each of them, we have an **opening tag** (like `<p>`), the content, and a **closing tag** (like `</p>`).

So `<opening tag> …content …. </closing tag>.`

Let’s make this into a practical example.

We’re going to use an online editor because I think it makes things so much faster. It just works, you can easily share what you do, get help when you’re stuck, etc.

There are many online tools you can use.

One tool I suggest is **Codepen**.

It’s a site that helps you experiment with creating Web pages easily, see the work of others, easily share your work, etc. 

On Codepen you can create a *pen* and see the result of your HTML without having to do things on your computer (and this means you can work on this from a tablet or a smartphone too)

Go to [https://codepen.io](https://codepen.io/) and create your free account.

I made a short video presentation that complements the lesson:

[Codepen intro.mp4](Introduction%20to%20HTML%201902767ad7e381229588f9eac998b9e9/Codepen_intro.mp4)

Here’s the HTML example I listed above in action on Codepen:

![Untitled](Introduction%20to%20HTML%201902767ad7e381229588f9eac998b9e9/Untitled.png)

See? We have 3 boxes - HTML, CSS, and JS.

And below we have the result as if we executed those 3 components in the browser.

It’s a quick way to test and experiment with Web technologies.

In the example, the browser interpreted the page, and automatically applied some special styling to the list, because it *knows* what an unordered list is, and it applies a default style.

It also added some spacing around the paragraph, that's different from the spacing between each list item.

I can share the link to the ”pen”: [https://codepen.io/flaviocopes/pen/ZEjbPEW](https://codepen.io/flaviocopes/pen/ZEjbPEW)

This is another cool feature of Codepen, you can share your work by sharing a link. People can see that project, run it, and also fork it to add their changes (they also have collaboration tools, but we’re not going to use them).

And also embed a pen anywhere, for example, I’ll embed the pen here so you can click “**Run pen**” and see the result live on this page:

[https://codepen.io/flaviocopes/pen/ZEjbPEW](https://codepen.io/flaviocopes/pen/ZEjbPEW)

Awesome! 

Now I want to tell you something about HTML you should know.

HTML is not *presentational*. **It’s not concerned with how things *look*. 

Instead, it’s concerned with what things ***mean***. 

You don't tell "make this paragraph red" in HTML. 

That’s a **presentational aspect**.

HTML is just concerned with content.

It just adds some predefined styles here and there, like for example with the list. But that’s it. There’s no customization you can do on how it looks, in HTML.

This will be the job of CSS, but that’s a story for another lesson.

Before going on, bookmark/download the HTML Handbook from [https://flaviocopes.com/books/](https://flaviocopes.com/books/) - it will be a useful resource.
