# Web Sites and Web Applications

A Web App is an application that runs inside the browser.

The browser was originally born as a way to display documents written in the Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML).

In 1995, JavaScript was developed and added to the Netscape Navigator browser, and quickly expanded.

After an early stage, where JavaScript and browsers were far, far less capable of what we can do today, we had a lot more power.

Apps like Google Maps and GMail, among many others, paved the way to an entire ecosystem.

Today the Web is an application platform. Powerful and complex apps run directly inside the browser. The browser is not just a document visualization tool: it's a runtime, a platform that executes other programs.
