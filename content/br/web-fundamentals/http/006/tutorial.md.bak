# HTTP Response Headers

Every HTTP response can have a set of headers.

Let's list the most important/useful response headers.

### `Age`

`Age: 12`

The age the object has been in a proxy cache in seconds

### `Cache-Control`

`Cache-Control: max-age=3600Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, max-age=0, must-revalidate`

If `no-cache` is used, the `Cache-Control` header can tell the browser to never use a cached version of a resource without first checking the ETag value.

`max-age` is measured in seconds

The more restrictive `no-store` option tells the browser (and all the intermediary network devices) the not even store the resource in its cache:

```
Cache-Control: no-store

```

### `Content-Disposition`

`Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="file.txt"`

An opportunity to raise a "File Download" dialogue box for a known MIME type with binary format or suggest a filename for dynamic content. Quotes are necessary with special characters

### `Content-Encoding`

`Content-Encoding: gzip`

The type of encoding used on the data. See HTTP compression

### `Content-Language`

`Content-Language: en`

The natural language or languages of the intended audience for the enclosed content

### `Content-Length`

`Content-Length: 348`

The length of the response body expressed in 8-bit bytes

### `Content-Type`

`Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8`

The MIME type of this content

### `Date`

`Date: Tue, 15 Nov 1994 08:12:31 GMT`

The date and time that the message was sent (in "HTTP-date" format as defined by RFC 7231)

### `ETag`

`ETag: "737060cd8c284d8a[...]"`

An identifier for a specific version of a resource, often a message digest

### `Expires`

`Expires: Sat, 01 Dec 2018 16:00:00 GMT`

Gives the date/time after which the response is considered stale (in "HTTP-date" format as defined by RFC 7231)

### `Last-Modified`

`Last-Modified: Mon, 15 Nov 2017 12:00:00 GMT`

The last modified date for the requested object (in "HTTP-date" format as defined by RFC 7231)

### `Location`

`Location: /pub/WWW/People.html`

Used in redirection, or when a new resource has been created

### `Server`

`Server: Apache/2.4.1 (Unix)`

A name for the server

### `Set-Cookie`

`Set-Cookie: UserID=JohnDoe; Max-Age=3600; Version=1`

Sets an HTTP cookie

## Non-standard headers

Some headers are non-standard.

### `Content-Security-Policy`

Helps to protect against XSS attacks. [See MDN for more details](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy)
