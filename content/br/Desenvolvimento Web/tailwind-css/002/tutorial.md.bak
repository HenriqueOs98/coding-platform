# PRACTICE: Styling an HTML page with Tailwind

Let’s try a simple exercise now. 

Remember the demo we did with CSS?

We had this HTML file:

```html
<html>
	<body>
		<div>
			<h1>Buy this great tool</h1>
			<p>Trusted by hundreds of companies</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Google</li>
				<li>Apple</li>
				<li>Meta</li>
			</ul>
			<button>Find out more</button>
	</div>
	</body>
</html>
```

As we did with CSS, we want to make the site look good, like on the right ⤵️

But this time, we’ll use Tailwind CSS.

To use Tailwind we need to configure it for our project.

Since we’ve used Codepen so far, here’s how to use Tailwind on Codepen.

Create an empty pen. Click the ⚙️ button in the HTML panel:

See the `Stuff for <head>` box?

Paste this into that:

```css
<script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
```

Click the **Save & Close** button. 

Try adding some code and Tailwind should be working, like in this simple example:

For convenience, I created a [starting template](https://codepen.io/flaviocopes/pen/MWBJWXZ?editors=1100).

[Here is the project I created](https://codepen.io/flaviocopes/pen/poZRoZx?editors=1000). Play around with it, and compare it with the “plain CSS” version.
