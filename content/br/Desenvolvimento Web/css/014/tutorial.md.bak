# PRACTICE: How to design UIs

This is not a design bootcamp, but as web developers, we're going to design user interfaces (UIs) all the time. Even if you'll eventually work in a team with designers, you'll design early drafts or your own utility apps. I want to show you the tools I use to design UIs.

The most obvious one is pen and paper. Another tool you might want to use is [Excalidraw.com](http://excalidraw.com/).

It's free, fast, and immediate. Let you sketch things out pretty quickly. A similar tool is [tldraw.com](https://www.tldraw.com/).

Another tool is [Figma](https://figma.com). This is more complex to use, but it lets you create more high-fidelity prototypes. Think of this as Photoshop for User Interface design.

I won't give you lessons on using them, but I'm going to make a quick video to show you my process.
